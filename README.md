### 👨‍💻 About Me
I am currently pursuing my **Master’s in Data Science at TU Wien**, with a strong academic focus on **machine learning, statistical inference, natural language processing, large language models, and data-intensive systems**.

Alongside my studies, I bring **8+ years of professional experience as a Performance Analyst**, where I designed **KPI frameworks, BI dashboards, and data-driven strategies** to optimize operations across **multi-sector industries**. I enjoy bridging theory and practice, turning complex data into actionable insights.

### 🚀 Featured Project
#### **QueryMinds — Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Academic QA**
As part of our **Natural Language Processing & Information Extraction** course, our team built **QueryMinds**, a complete **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system for academic question answering.

**Highlights:**
- End-to-end NLP pipeline from raw academic PDFs to CoNLL-U corpora  
- Multiple retrieval baselines (TF–IDF, embeddings, supervised classifiers)
- Dense retrieval with **FAISS**
- **Vanilla RAG** and **Strictly Constrained RAG** setups
- Local LLM inference with **TinyLlama**
- Manual and LLM-assisted labeling for embedding fine-tuning
- Qualitative analysis of hallucinations and grounding

📌 *Focus: faithfulness, retrieval quality, and hallucination control in RAG systems*
